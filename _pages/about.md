### About me <br/> <br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD scholar in the Neuromechanics lab at IIT, Madras and the Biological Learning and Rehabilitation group at CMC, Vellore. I have a background in Computer Science and Computational Neuroscience. My interests in machine learning and its underlying inspirations from Neuroscience motivated me to pursue a second masters in Computational Neuroscience from BCCN, Berlin. Following my curiosity on infinite application opportunities of computational modelling in the medical domain, I have decided to pursue my PhD on the usage of machine learning/deep learning models for arm use assessment in Stroke patients using wearable sensors.
