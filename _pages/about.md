### About me <br/> <br/>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am a PhD scholar in the Neuromechanics Lab at IIT Madras and the Biological Learning and Rehabilitation Group at CMC Vellore. I have a background in Computer Science and Computational Neuroscience. My interests in machine learning and its underlying inspirations from neuroscience motivated me to pursue a second master's in Computational Neuroscience from BCCN, Berlin. Following my curiosity about the infinite application opportunities of computational modeling in the medical domain, I have decided to pursue my PhD on the usage of machine learning/deep learning models for arm use assessment in stroke patients using wearable sensors.
